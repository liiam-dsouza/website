            Career Chats is an ongoing series where I sit down with people working in tech to talk about how they actually got here - the non-linear paths, challenges along the way, and lessons they've learned.

                    Breaking into tech can feel opaque. Job titles are unclear, career paths are rarely linear, and most advice focuses on outcomes rather than journeys.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Career Chats exists to make those journeys visible — by documenting honest conversations with people at different stages of their careers and sharing what they wish they knew earlier.

                    <li>What the guest does day-to-day</li>

                    <li>Challenges and unexpected detours</li>
                    <li>Advice for students and early-career professionals</li>

                    Episodes are short, focused, and designed to be practical.

                I started Career Chats as a way to learn from people I admire and to share those insights with others navigating similar decisions. Along the way, patterns start to emerge - and those patterns are often more valuable than any single piece of advice.
            </p>

                If you're working in tech and would like to be part of the series - or if there's someone you'd like me to chat with - feel free to get in touch.
