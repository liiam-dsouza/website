                This site was built using <a href="https://astro.build/" class="text-primary underline">Astro</a>, a modern static site generator.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Styling is handled with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-primary underline">Tailwind CSS</a>, providing a utility-first approach to design. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                The design follows a minimalist aesthetic, utilising a custom color palette and typography to ensure readability and visual appeal. Components such as <a href="/components/Projects" class="text-primary underline">Projects</a> and <a href="/components/Posts" class="text-primary underline">Posts</a> are reused throughout the site to maintain consistency.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Hosting is provided by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages" class="text-primary underline">GitHub Pages</a>, ensuring fast load times and reliable uptime. Continuous deployment is set up to automatically update the site whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                I value fast load times, minimal JavaScript, and interfaces that feel calm and intentional. Most pages are static, and any interactivity is added only when it earns its place.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Posts here are written slowly and edited over time. If something changes, it usually means I learned something or changed my mind.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                There are a few small easter eggs hidden around the site. They exist purely to reward curiosity.
