        <Heading>🎙️ Speaking</Heading>
        <p>
            I have a strong interest in building thoughtful, human-centric tech experiences - and public speaking is a big part of how I explore and share that work.
            I speak at meetups, workshops, and university events, and I've also MC'd events and chaired panel discussions.
        </p>

        <p>
            My sessions are grounded in real projects, lived experience, and a genuine curiosity for how people learn.
            Whether I'm presenting technical concepts, facilitating discussion, or hosting an event, my goal is always the same: to create spaces that feel engaging, accessible, and meaningful.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">🧩 Formats & Roles</h3>
        <p>
            I've contributed to events in a variety of formats and roles, including:

        <p>
            This flexibility allows me to support events in ways that go beyond a single talk slot. Whether it’s guiding discussions, engaging audiences through interactive formats, or tailoring content to specific groups, I enjoy adapting my approach to fit the needs of each event.

            Below is a selection of talks, panels, and events I've been involved in. Each entry reflects the role I played - whether that was speaking, hosting, or guiding conversation - and the type of session delivered.
        </p>

        <p>
            These range from technical deep dives and introductory workshops to panel facilitation and event hosting in student and developer-focused spaces.
