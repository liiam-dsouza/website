        <Heading>📂 Resources</Heading>
        <p>
            I've learned a lot through building, teaching, and exploring - often by standing on the shoulders of great tools, ideas, and people.
            This page is a curated collection of resources I regularly recommend, use, or create myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether you're here after a workshop, exploring a topic on your own, or just curious, these resources are designed to be practical, approachable, and easy to come back to.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="learning-paths" class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">🧭 Learning Paths</h3>
        <p>
            If you're new to a topic or unsure where to start, these learning paths offer a short, structured way in. Each path is intentionally lightweight, with a small number of hand-picked resources and brief context on why they matter.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="tools-software" class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">🛠️ Tools & Software I Use</h3>
        <p>
            These are tools I actively use or recommend - not because they're trendy, but because they've proven useful in real projects, workshops, and everyday workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
            Where relevant, I've included brief notes on how I use each tool or what makes it stand out.
        </p>

    <section id="workshop-resources" class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">📚 Workshop Resources</h3>
        <p>
            Resources from workshops and sessions I've run or contributed to. These are designed to be practical, reusable, and beginner-friendly.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you attended a session, this is a good place to revisit materials. If you didn't, many of these resources still stand on their own.

            A curated selection of articles, talks, and papers that have shaped how I think about technology, learning, and building.

        <p>
            This isn’t an exhaustive list - just things I genuinely return to or frequently recommend.
