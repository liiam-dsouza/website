## Context
When building web applications, it's often necessary to create URL-friendly slugs from strings, such as titles or names. A slug is a simplified version of a string that can be used in URLs, typically consisting of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

## The idea
The `slugify` helper function takes a string as input and transforms it into a slug by:
1. Converting the string to lowercase.
2. Replacing spaces and special characters with hyphens.
3. Removing any non-alphanumeric characters except for hyphens.

```typescript
export const slugify = (input: string): string => {
    return input
        .toLowerCase()
        .trim()
        .replace(/[^\w\s-]/g, "") // remove non-word characters
        .replace(/\s+/g, "-")     // spaces → dashes
        .replace(/-+/g, "-")      // collapse multiple dashes
}
```
