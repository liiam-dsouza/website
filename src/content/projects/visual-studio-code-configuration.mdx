This is my highly customised Visual Studio Code configuration designed to create a minimal, distraction-free coding environment with the Catppuccin Mocha theme. The configuration focuses on removing visual clutter, improving focus, and creating a clean aesthetic while maintaining productivity features.

## Installed Extensions

The configuration uses three carefully selected extensions:

### 1. **Catppuccin Theme** (<Highlight>catppuccin. catppuccin-vsc</Highlight>)
**Purpose:** Provides the Catppuccin color theme for VS Code

This extension applies the "Catppuccin Mocha" theme, which is a warm, pastel-based color scheme designed to be easy on the eyes during long coding sessions.  The Mocha variant specifically uses darker backgrounds with soothing purple, pink, and blue accent colors.

### 2. **Catppuccin Icons** (<Highlight>catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc-icons</Highlight>)
**Purpose:** Provides matching file and folder icons

This extension complements the Catppuccin theme by adding consistent iconography throughout the editor. The icons use the same color palette as the theme, creating a cohesive visual experience.  The configuration specifically hides explorer arrows for an even cleaner look.

### 3. **Custom UI Style** (<Highlight>subframe7536.custom-ui-style</Highlight>)
**Purpose:** Advanced UI customization through custom CSS

This extension allows deep customization of VS Code's interface through custom stylesheets and Electron settings. It enables modifications that aren't possible through standard VS Code settings, such as:
- Custom positioning of macOS traffic lights (window control buttons)
- Removal of box shadows and borders
- Custom positioning of UI elements
- Fine-tuned spacing and padding adjustments

## Configuration Philosophy

The configuration follows a **minimalist, distraction-free philosophy** with these core principles:

### 1. **Reduced Visual Clutter**
- Hidden activity bar, status bar, and minimap
- Disabled breadcrumbs and sticky scroll
- Removed scrollbars (while maintaining scroll functionality)
- Hidden file icons and decorations in many areas
- No indent guides or whitespace rendering

### 2. **Focus on Content**
- Single tab mode to focus on one file at a time
- No startup editor (clean slate on launch)
- Relative line numbers for easier navigation
- Disabled tips and recommendations

### 3. **Cleaner Git Integration**
- Disabled git decorations to reduce visual noise
- No diff decorations in source control view

### 4. **Optimized Typography**
- JetBrains Mono Nerd Font for excellent code readability
- Font ligatures enabled for cleaner operators
- Increased line height (2x) for better readability
- Italic comments for visual distinction

## Notes

- This configuration is optimized for **focus and minimalism** over displaying all possible information
- Many features are hidden but still accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- The setup works best on larger screens where the zoom level and spacing are comfortable
- Some customisations may require VS Code restart to take full effect
- The configuration disables automatic updates (`"update.mode": "none"`) - remember to update manually
