A modern, performant personal portfolio website built with Astro's static site generation framework. The site serves as a central hub for my online presence, showcasing my work, projects, and professional experience with an emphasis on speed, accessibility, and clean design.

Built with a content-first architecture, the website leverages MDX for rich, interactive content authoring and TypeScript for type-safe development, delivering near-instant page loads through static pre-rendering.

## Project Context

As a developer, having a strong online presence is essential for showcasing work and connecting with the community. I built this website to address several key goals:

- **Portfolio Showcase**: A centralised platform to display projects, technical writeups, and professional accomplishments
- **Performance-First**: Deliver an exceptional user experience with minimal JavaScript and optimal loading times
- **Content Flexibility**: Enable rich content authoring that goes beyond basic markdown while maintaining simplicity
- **Maintainability**: Create a sustainable codebase that's easy to update and extend over time

I chose Astro as the foundation because of its unique approach to web development—shipping zero JavaScript by default and supporting multiple component frameworks.  This aligns perfectly with the goal of creating a fast, content-focused site without sacrificing modern development practices.

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages with automated continuous deployment, ensuring updates are published instantly upon pushing to the main branch.

## Key Features

- **Static Site Generation:** Pre-rendered pages at build time for optimal performance and SEO, with near-instant page loads and minimal time-to-interactive.

- **Content Collections:** Organised content management using Astro's content layer, making it easy to manage projects, blog posts, and other content types with type-safe frontmatter.

- **MDX Support:** Rich content authoring that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX components, enabling interactive elements within written content.

- **Type-Safe Development:** Full TypeScript integration throughout the codebase for better developer experience, fewer runtime errors, and improved maintainability.

- **Component-Driven Architecture:** Reusable Astro components for consistent UI patterns and streamlined development, following modern component-based design principles.

- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS utility classes, ensuring the site looks great on all devices and screen sizes.

- **Zero JavaScript by Default:** Astro's island architecture ensures minimal JavaScript is shipped to the client, only hydrating interactive components when necessary.
