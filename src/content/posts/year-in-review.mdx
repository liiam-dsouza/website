Somewhere between late nights preparing slides, early mornings at conferences, and quiet moments of reflection after events wrapped up, this year quietly became one of the most formative ones yet.

What stands out isn't just *what* I did, but *how* it all connected - learning by doing, leaning into community, and getting more comfortable saying yes to opportunities that once felt intimidating. Each experience added a little more confidence, curiosity, and clarity about where I want to head next.

## Stepping Into Cybersecurity: CrikeyCon

One of the highlights of the year was attending my first CrikeyCon with members of the QUT Cyber Security Club. The day kicked off with the CrikeyCon CTF - my first proper capture-the-flag competition. Our team finished 4th out of 90+ teams with 3370 points, which felt like a huge win and a great introduction to hands-on security challenges.

Beyond the competition, the talks really stuck with me. Kelsy Luengen's talk reframed how I think about security culture, highlighting how employees can actively contribute to organisational security. Justin Steven's talk was a reminder of just how big the ripple effects of a small vulnerability can be, walking through how a bypass in firmware update signature checking impacted over 100,000 Linux machines.

## Sharing What I'm Learning: ACS EPC AI in Action

Later in the year, I had the opportunity to present at the ACS EPC AI in Action event. I shared how I've been experimenting with running local LLMs inside Obsidian using Ollama, and how local AI tools can meaningfully improve productivity and personal workflows.

I also spoke about customising tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot - through prompts, system instructions, and behaviour tweaks - so they work *with* the way we think, rather than forcing a generic workflow.

As a student, I wanted to emphasise using AI thoughtfully and critically: not as a shortcut, but as a tool to support deeper thinking and creativity.

## Community at Scale: QUT Tech Industry Night

One of the biggest undertakings of the year was leading the planning for the 2025 QUT Tech Industry Night and serving as MC on the night. What started months earlier grew into a collaboration between 10 student clubs across QUT.

Seeing a room full of students, alumni, and industry professionals connecting and sharing insights made all the behind-the-scenes work worth it. We were fortunate to be joined by organisations including AISA, Datacom, Deloitte Digital, and Suncorp Group.

Leading and MC'ing the night pushed me well outside my comfort zone, but reinforced how powerful strong, supportive communities can be.

## Saying Yes to the Mic: AgentCon Brisbane

Speaking at AgentCon Brisbane was one of those moments that felt both energising and surreal. Being part of a developer-focused conference centred on building and scaling AI agents reinforced how valuable it is to share ideas openly and learn through conversation.

It was a reminder that growth often happens not just through building things, but through discussing them with people who challenge and expand your thinking.

## Bridging Students and Industry: Supanova Level Up

I also had the opportunity to chair the “Real Stories, Real Success” session at Supanova Comic Con & Gaming's *Level Up* Tech Career Fair. Helping facilitate honest conversations about internships, graduate programs, and career paths was incredibly rewarding.

Events like this help demystify the industry and remind students that there's no single 'correct' way into tech.

## Final Thoughts

Looking back, this year was less about ticking boxes and more about momentum. Each event built on the last - learning, sharing, organising, and gradually growing into roles that once felt well outside my comfort zone.

I'm grateful for the people I met, the conversations I had, and the communities I was lucky to be part of. If there's one thing I'm carrying forward, it's this: meaningful growth rarely comes from waiting until you feel ready. It comes from curiosity, community, and being willing to show up.

If any of this resonates, or if you're working on something interesting, I'm always keen to have a chat - feel free to reach out.
